Got it! Here are some of the most frequently asked HTML questions that often come up in React.js interviews, focusing on basic HTML knowledge that is particularly relevant for React developers:

1. **What are HTML attributes? Give examples of common attributes.**
   - **Answer:** HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. Common attributes include `id`, `class`, `src`, `href`, and `alt`.
   - **Example:** 
     ```html
     <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" class="image-class" />
     ```

2. **What is the purpose of the `<head>` section in an HTML document?**
   - **Answer:** The `<head>` section contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, links to stylesheets, scripts, and metadata.
   - **Example:**
     ```html
     <head>
       <title>My Page Title</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
     </head>
     ```

3. **What is the difference between the `<link>` and `<script>` tags?**
   - **Answer:** The `<link>` tag is used to link external resources like stylesheets, while the `<script>` tag is used to include JavaScript files or inline scripts.
   - **Example:**
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
     <script src="script.js"></script>
     ```

4. **How do you create a list in HTML? What are the differences between ordered and unordered lists?**
   - **Answer:** Lists are created using `<ul>` for unordered lists and `<ol>` for ordered lists. Unordered lists use bullet points, while ordered lists use numbers.
   - **Example:**
     ```html
     <ul>
       <li>Item 1</li>
       <li>Item 2</li>
     </ul>
     <ol>
       <li>First Item</li>
       <li>Second Item</li>
     </ol>
     ```

5. **What is the purpose of the `<title>` tag?**
   - **Answer:** The `<title>` tag sets the title of the HTML document, which appears in the browser tab and is used by search engines for indexing.
   - **Example:**
     ```html
     <head>
       <title>My Webpage</title>
     </head>
     ```

6. **What is the difference between the `GET` and `POST` methods in HTML forms?**
   - **Answer:** The `GET` method appends form data to the URL and is used for retrieving data, while the `POST` method sends data in the request body and is used for submitting data securely.
   - **Example:**
     ```html
     <form action="/submit" method="GET">
       <input type="text" name="query" />
       <button type="submit">Search</button>
     </form>
     ```

7. **How can you include a stylesheet in your HTML document?**
   - **Answer:** You can include a stylesheet using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section of your document.
   - **Example:**
     ```html
     <head>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
     </head>
     ```

8. **What are the semantic elements in HTML5? Name a few.**
   - **Answer:** Semantic elements clearly describe their meaning in a way that both browsers and developers can understand. Examples include `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>`.
   - **Example:**
     ```html
     <header>
       <h1>Site Title</h1>
     </header>
     <nav>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
         <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
       </ul>
     </nav>
     ```

9. **What is the difference between inline and block elements? Provide examples.**
   - **Answer:** Block elements occupy the full width and start on a new line (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`), while inline elements occupy only as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line (e.g., `<span>`, `<a>`).
   - **Example:**
     ```html
     <div>This is a block element.</div>
     <span>This is an inline element.</span>
     ```

10. **How do you create a table in HTML?**
    - **Answer:** A table is created using the `<table>` tag, along with `<tr>` for rows, `<th>` for header cells, and `<td>` for data cells.
    - **Example:**
      ```html
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Age</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Alice</td>
            <td>25</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Bob</td>
            <td>30</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      ```

These questions and answers focus on fundamental HTML concepts that are essential for any web development role, especially when working with React.
