In this article, we will explore some of the most common problem-solving questions asked in JavaScript interviews, especially those focusing on React and object manipulation. We will also provide solutions to these questions, giving you a practical approach to solving them during an interview.

## 1. React: How to conditionally render a component in React?

### Problem:
You need to conditionally render a component in React based on a specific condition.

### Solution:
You can use JavaScript's ternary operator or logical `&&` operator to conditionally render a component.

```jsx
const MyComponent = ({ isLoggedIn }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn ? <p>Welcome back, user!</p> : <p>Please log in.</p>}
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, the component renders different messages depending on the value of `isLoggedIn`.

## 2. React: How to pass data between components in React?

### Problem:
How do you pass data from a parent component to a child component?

### Solution:
To pass data between components, use props.

```jsx
const ParentComponent = () => {
  const message = "Hello from the parent!";
  return <ChildComponent message={message} />;
};

const ChildComponent = ({ message }) => {
  return <p>{message}</p>;
};
```

In this example, the parent component passes the `message` variable as a prop to the child component, which can then use it.

## 3. JavaScript: How to deep clone an object?

### Problem:
You are given a JavaScript object, and you need to create a deep copy of it without maintaining references to the original object.

### Solution:
You can use the structured cloning algorithm with `structuredClone` or manually deep clone the object using recursion.

```js
// Using structuredClone
const original = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const clone = structuredClone(original);

// Manual deep cloning
function deepClone(obj) {
  if (obj === null || typeof obj !== "object") {
    return obj;
  }

  if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
    return obj.map(deepClone);
  }

  const clonedObj = {};
  for (const key in obj) {
    clonedObj[key] = deepClone(obj[key]);
  }

  return clonedObj;
}
```

The first method, `structuredClone`, is the most modern and recommended way. The second is a manual implementation that handles both objects and arrays.

## 4. JavaScript: How to merge two objects in JavaScript?

### Problem:
You need to merge two JavaScript objects into one.

### Solution:
Use the spread operator (`...`) or `Object.assign()`.

```js
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { b: 3, c: 4 };

// Using spread operator
const merged = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };

// Using Object.assign()
const mergedAssign = Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2);
```

Both methods will create a new object where properties from `obj2` overwrite properties in `obj1` with the same key.

## 5. JavaScript: How to find duplicate elements in an array?

### Problem:
You have an array of numbers, and you need to find the duplicate elements in it.

### Solution:
You can use a `Set` to keep track of seen elements and filter out duplicates.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6, 2];
const duplicates = numbers.filter((item, index) => numbers.indexOf(item) !== index);

console.log(duplicates); // Output: [3, 2]
```

This code finds all the duplicates in the array by checking the index of each element and comparing it to its first occurrence.
